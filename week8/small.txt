Module Reference
The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling. The
builtin open function is defined in this module.
 
At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to raise an OSError if they do not support a given operation.
